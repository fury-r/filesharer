# FileShare Web Application



## Overview
The FileShare Web Application is a platform built to facilitate easy sharing of files through file uploads and QR code generation. It utilizes React with TypeScript on the frontend and Django with Python on the backend. The app allows users to upload files, generate QR codes for those files, and share them effortlessly.

## Features
- **File Upload:** Users can easily upload files of various formats.
- **QR Code Generation:** Automatically generates QR codes for each uploaded file.
- **File Sharing:** Share files by scanning QR codes generated by the application.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - TypeScript: Adds static typing to JavaScript to improve code quality.
  - Vite: A build tool for modern web development.
- **Backend:**
  - Django: High-level Python web framework for rapid development.
  - Python: Backend programming language.
- **Other Tools:**
  - QR Code Generator Library: Used to dynamically generate QR codes.
  - Axios: HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
  - Django REST Framework: Toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.

## Installation
1. **Backend Setup:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
   - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations`
   - Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
   - Start the backend server: `python manage.py runserver`

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
